= Land Boards Host Sourced Serial Programming (RPPSOC) =

* These are the HSSP Host Sourced Serial Programming files for the RPPSOC.
* The HSSP code is based on [http://www.cypress.com/documentation/application-notes/an73054-psoc-3-and-psoc-5lp-programming-using-externalApplication Note AN73054] from Cypress Semiconductor.

== HSSP Porting Details ==

* Land Boards has heavily modified the HSSP code to work with a Raspberry Pi as the Host.
* These changes make a simple comparison of the two source codes difficult.
* Some of the changes that we made are for style.
* Most of the changes that we made were required for function.
* The HSSP code was originally written to run on a PSOC as a Host processor to another PSOC.
* The Raspberry Pi does not have the same limits as a PSOC.
** Executable size is not limited as it is for a PSOC.

== Dependencies ==

* The main external dependency is [http://wiringpi.com/ WiringPi].
** WiringPi is a GPIO library for the Raspberry Pi.
** WiringPi allows for extremely GPIO fast access - much faster than Python provides.
* Other dependencies, like the gcc compiler are standard with Debian.
** Other OS's may require changes.

== Ownership ==

* Some of these files (particularly libraries) were created by others.
** There may be newer versions of these libraries "out there".
** Some libraries even have the same names but don't work the same.
* Many of these files were created by me based on the work of others.

== Warning ==

* Use at your own risk.
** If you brick your part or it melt to a puddle, it's on you not me.
